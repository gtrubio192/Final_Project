# The Click-n-Pick My Site

Final project for the Iron Yard 

##Description

 Start with why, then how, then what.

I believe that businesses and individuals alike should have the freedom to represent and express themselves through digital mediums easily, and affordably. We have always found forms of expression throughout human history - cave paintings, wooden signs, television commercials, hand written then typed books. All in an enduring quest to express ourselves and have our ideas and voices heard. These days, the most powerful medium of self expression is through the internet, but this also has certain set backs. There is a learning curve that not everyone can overcome or has to the time to. This is why I believe that my user friendly, click-and-pick webpage will be the light at the end of the tunnel for those seeking to proliferate their great ideas across the digital sphere. 

By using existing libraries and technologies, not so tech savvy internet users can now create their very own custom website in minutes. Using a series of checkboxes, users will have an array of color themes to choose from that better suit their individual or business needs. Additionally, users will be able to upload and change their logos or photos that they would like to share.
